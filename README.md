Hi!

This project contains information regarding multiple interviews done during 2020 and 2021 related to Coronavirus and how the ex-President of the US handled it.

The objective of this academic exercise is to learn how to work with python projects, organizing the code by modules and including the typical text documents that any project would include.

How to use it: install requirements and just run the notebook answers_PEC4.ipynb

The structure consist on:
-	Scripts: data_load.py (where all the data objects are defined), exploration_manipulation.py (includes are the functions relates to data manipulation and exploration) and visualizations.py (includes functions that represents different graphs from the datasets)
-	Notebook: answers_PEC4.ipynb (It contains the answer to all the question of this assignment and shows different graphs)
-	test.py: tests for the functions.
-	requirements.txt: contains the python libraries needed in order to execute the project


**To run the testss access to the project's directory and run test.py**


Coverage report:

Name     | Stmts |  Miss | Cover

test.py  | 70    |  10   |  86%

TOTAL    |  70   |  10   |  86%
